This is one of the projects of my personal portfolio, so, any feedback about the project, code or anything that you can report that could make me a better developer will be welcome!

I build this project to test my knowlodge about react, react router, react hooks, styled componentes, but mainly for see how can we use the routing of react-router instead manually routing and to take my first try with more complex process of componentization.

I'll add one more feature in the future: display one input for each seat.
